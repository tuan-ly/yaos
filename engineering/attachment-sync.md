# Attachment Sync: Content-Addressing and Bounded Fan-Out

Markdown text belongs in the CRDT. Images, PDFs and other binary file-types are handled via a separate, content-addressed blob synchronization pipeline backed by Cloudflare R2 object storage.

### The Native Worker Proxy

Earlier iterations of YAOS used a complex two-phase commit involving S3 presigned URLs, because PartyKit's managed infrastructure obscured the underlying Cloudflare bindings, our server could not natively talk to our R2 storage bucket. We had to treat R2 like a generic external AWS S3 bucket.

The client would ask the server for permission, the server would cryptographically sign an AWS S3 fetch URL, and the client would talk directly to the bucket.

We deleted that brittle state machine. YAOS now utilizes direct native R2 bindings inside the Cloudflare Worker. The client computes the SHA-256 hash of the file and does a simple authenticated `PUT` directly to the Worker. The Worker then natively proxies the bytes to `env.YAOS_BUCKET`.

This native proxy approach drastically simplifies the client logic, eliminates the need for external `aws4fetch` signing libraries, and completely removes the need to parse S3 XML responses.

### Bounding the Cloudflare Fan-Out

When checking which blobs already exist in R2 (to achieve content-addressed deduplication), the naive approach is to use an unbounded `Promise.all(...)` fan-out to check multiple hashes at once.

This is an anti-pattern for Cloudflare Workers. A single Worker invocation is strictly limited to 6 simultaneous open connections. Native R2 operations—including `head()`, `get()`, `put()`, `delete()`, and `list()`—all count toward that absolute ceiling. Unbounded scatter/gather bursts consume the subrequest budget, create massive connection pressure, and cause the Worker to crash.

To solve this, YAOS uses a strict, concurrency-limited worker pool. Concurrent R2 operations are capped at 4. This intentionally sits below Cloudflare's 6-connection ceiling, ensuring the Worker always maintains headroom for other concurrent tasks and gracefully handles high-volume existence checks without dropping requests.

### The Block-Level Chunking Trap

I really like how Dropbox and Onedrive do block-level file sync. 

Imagine you had a 50 MB PDF, and you open it to read, and you make one highlight. The file is updated, so it has to be uploaded to the server. If we chunked a 50MB PDF into 50 separate 1MB blobs (actually, the blocks are much smaller, like 4KB) in R2, we would only have to upload the modified chunks when the file changes. However, this introduces a massive architectural burden: **Distributed Garbage Collection**.

If a user deletes or modifies that PDF, the server must track which of those 1MB chunks are now orphaned and which are still actively shared by other files in the vault. We would have to build a highly-available Reference Counting Garbage Collector. A single race condition in the GC would permanently corrupt users' files by deleting a chunk that is still in use.

Moreover, building this in JS would be really inefficient. Bandwidth is cheap; distributed garbage collection is a nightmare. Instead, YAOS uses standard Last-Writer-Wins full file overwrites.

## Blob Sync Queues

Attachment synchronization in YAOS intentionally avoids complex asynchronous scheduling in favor of a simple batch-based queue.

If a user uploads a 50MB video and a 50KB image in the same batch, the image file waits for the video to finish before the *next* batch can start.

This is a deliberate design choice prioritizing stability over maximal throughput. We did not build an asynchronous lock-free worker pool with exponential backoff and persistent state reconciliation. These are notorious for introducing subtle retry and resume bugs.

Because disk writes now run through a universal per-path lock, blob sync is primarily a throughput and backpressure concern, not a core text-correctness concern.

We use the network bandwidth slightly less efficiently because of batch boundaries, though

- It doesn't permanently leak concurrency slots.
- It doesn't create race conditions between the in-memory queue and the IndexedDB persisted state.
- It doesn't re-order operations in a way that breaks your expected timeline.

This can be worked on, if we care about high blob I/O.

### Hardened Upload Limits and Integrity

To protect the server infrastructure and prevent accidental giant uploads from generating needless bandwidth churn, the server enforces a hard maximum upload size of 10 MB on the Worker proxy route. This explicitly matches the plugin's default attachment policy. (This cap applies exclusively to blob attachments, not to the live CRDT WebSocket stream or server-side snapshot creation). This can be easily increased.

Finally, to ensure absolute integrity of the snapshot safety net, snapshot IDs are generated using cryptographic randomness rather than predictable `Math.random()` calls.
